To solve this project I create two java filer to relate with each other. It can better distribute the responsibility
so that I would not get duplicate code as much as possible. I create a first class with the name of 'Vocabulary
Handler' that relate to the second class with the name of 'Vocabulary'. Due to the project have Swedish
as the prompt vocabulary and English from the user as the answer vocabulary, I create two String variable both 'prompt' and
'answer' in 'Vocabulary' that can use in the 'VocabularyHandler' java file. To separate the project I create three method
in this program. A method to print the program instruction, a method to create the array for these vocabularies and also
a method to get the input from the user. I choose these divisions because of these methods make my program easy to work,
make my code easy to understand and also easy for my program to add new functions in the future. I make sure that there
are no more code in the main method, which make my program easy to add and run a new method. It is ok that I create my array
in my main method but I do not think that is good solution in this project, because it is more complex if I want to add a
new function in the future. I create my array in a new method which make I can better control my program and as I mention
before it is better for the future to add a new function in my program.
